# Stellar app for the Ledger Nano S

## Introduction

This is a wallet app for the [Ledger Nano S](https://www.ledgerwallet.com/products/ledger-nano-s).

It is currently work in progress.

I am simultaneously developing a [Javascript library](https://github.com/lenondupe/stellar-ledger-api) to communicate with this app. There you will find some scripts in order to test the app.

## Building and installing

To build and install the app on your Nano Ledger S you must set up the Nano Ledger S build environment. Please follow the Getting Started instructions at the [Ledger Nano S github repository](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-nano-s).

Alternatively, if you are on a Mac, you can set up the Vagrant Virtualbox Ledger environment maintained [here](https://github.com/fix/ledger-vagrant). This sets up an Ubuntu virtual machine with the Ledger build environment already set up. Note that at the time of this writing this seems to be the only way to build and install on a Mac. The native Ledger Nano S build environment is currently not working.
